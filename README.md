# expense-tracker

👋 Hello there!

📝 Thank you for checking out my expense tracker project. This project is designed to help you keep track of your expenses, so you can manage your finances more effectively.

🔧 To use this expense tracker, simply input your expenses and their amounts into the tracker. You can categorize your expenses by type (e.g. food, transportation, entertainment), and you can also set a budget for each category. The tracker will then calculate your total expenses and compare them to your budget, giving you a clear picture of your spending habits.

📈 The tracker also provides visualizations of your spending over time, so you can see how your expenses are changing over time and identify any trends.

📁 To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and run the main.py file. You will need to have Python and Flask installed on your system.

👍 If you have any questions or feedback about this project, please feel free to reach out to me. I hope you find this expense tracker useful!
